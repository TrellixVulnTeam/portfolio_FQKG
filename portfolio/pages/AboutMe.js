      <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        I recently decided to re-train and join the tech industry and I am
        currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp to become a full stack software
        developer. I previously worked in the global pharmaceutical industry &
        UK NHS/academic sectors with extensive industry experience in clinical &
        medical device trials, budget & vendor management, training and line
        management.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As part of this bootcamp I have coded remotely using pair programming
        and as part of agile teams and I have developed apps in both vanilla
        languages and frameworks (React, Node, Express) utilising UI libraries
        which have been presented to industry leaders as part of tech demo days.
